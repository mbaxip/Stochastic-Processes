function [Dx,Dy]=dgrad(dims,shape)
% [Dx,Dy]=dgrad(dims,'shape')
%
% Dx,Dy : Discrete approximations to the x and y gradient operators. 
% dims  : Vector of dimensions of the associated discrete field,
%         dims=[n1,n2] for an (n1 X n2) field. 
% shape : OPTIONAL. String specificying the shape of the resulting
%         derivative matrices. In general a discrete derivative results in a
%         row or column dimension one lower than the original. By
%         setting this parameter to shape='same', matrices are produce that
%         retain the original shape. i.e. Dx and Dy will be square.
%         DEFAULT: shape = 'same'
%
% If F is an (n1 X n2) 2D field and f=F(:) is its vector representation,
% then Dx*f is a discrete approximation of the x gradient and Dy*f is a
% discrete approximation of the y gradient. In particular:
%
%      [-I  I     ]         [D       ]       [-1  1     ]
%      [  \  \    ]         [  \     ]       [  \  \    ]
% Dx = [   \  \   ],   Dy = [   \    ],  D = [   \  \   ]
%      [    \  \  ]         [    \   ]       [    \  \  ]
%      [    -I  I ]         [      D ]       [    -1  1 ]
% 
% where I is a n1 X n1 identity matrix. Dx is (n1*n2-n1 X n1*n2) and Dy
% is (n1*n2-n2 X n1*n2). Dx and Dy are generated as sparse matrices. Note:
% If the field is a column vector (n1 X 1) then Dx will be empty and Dy will
% be the 1-D derivative along the column. Conversely, if the field is a row
% vector (1 X n2) then Dy will be empty and Dx will be the 1-D derative
% across the row. Note that this is the logical behavior.
